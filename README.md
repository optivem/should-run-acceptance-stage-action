# Should Run Acceptance Stage Action

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action)](https://github.com/optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action/releases)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action)](LICENSE)

A GitHub Action that determines whether an acceptance stage should run based on Docker image creation timestamps or a force run flag. This action accepts Docker inspect JSON data (single image or array of images) and compares the image creation time with the last successful workflow run, helping optimize CI/CD pipelines by only running acceptance tests when there are actual changes to test.

> **Note**: This action now works with any Docker image from any registry. Simply provide the output of `docker inspect <image>` as input.

## Features

- üîç **Smart Detection**: Compares Docker image creation timestamps with last successful acceptance run
- üöÄ **Force Run Option**: Bypass image detection and force acceptance stage to run
- üìä **Detailed Outputs**: Provides comprehensive information about the decision and discovered images
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Reduces unnecessary acceptance test runs
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and parsing failures
- üê≥ **Registry Agnostic**: Works with any Docker registry (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, ACR, etc.)
- üì¶ **Multi-Image Support**: Can process single images or arrays of images

### With Force Run Option

```yaml

  id: check
  uses: optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action@v1
  with:
    acceptance-stage-repo-owner: 'your-org'
    acceptance-stage-repo-name: 'your-repo'
    latest-image-inspect-results: '${{ needs.build.outputs.docker-inspect }}'
    acceptance-stage-workflow-name: 'acceptance-tests.yml'
    force-run: 'true'  # Force run regardless of image changes
```

### Using Different Versions

```yaml
# Use specific version
- uses: optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action@v1.0.0

# Use latest v1.x
- uses: optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action@v1

# Use main branch (not recommended for production)
- uses: optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action@main
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `latest-image-inspect-results` | Array of Docker inspect JSON results containing image metadata. Can be a single image `[{...}]` or multiple images `[{...}, {...}]` | ‚úÖ | - |
| `acceptance-stage-repo-owner` | Repository owner (organization or username) | ‚ùå | `${{ github.repository_owner }}` |
| `acceptance-stage-repo-name` | Repository name | ‚ùå | `${{ github.event.repository.name }}` |
| `acceptance-stage-workflow-name` | Name of the acceptance stage workflow file | ‚ùå | `acceptance-stage` |
| `force-run` | Force run even if no new images (bypasses image detection) | ‚ùå | `false` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `should-run` | Whether the acceptance stage should run (`true`/`false`) |

## How It Works

1. **Last Run Detection**: Queries the GitHub API to find the timestamp of the last successful acceptance workflow run
2. **Image Analysis**: Parses the provided Docker inspect JSON data to extract the image creation timestamp
3. **Decision Logic**: 
   - If `force-run` is `true`: Always runs acceptance stage
   - If image creation time is newer than last successful run: Runs acceptance stage
   - If image creation time is older than last successful run: Skips acceptance stage
4. **Output Generation**: Provides detailed information about the decision for transparency

## Supported Registries

This action works with **any Docker registry** including:
- **Docker Hub** (`docker.io`)
- **GitHub Container Registry** (`ghcr.io`)
- **Amazon ECR** (`*.dkr.ecr.*.amazonaws.com`)
- **Azure Container Registry** (`*.azurecr.io`)
- **Google Container Registry** (`gcr.io`, `*.gcr.io`)
- **Private registries** and **self-hosted registries**

Simply provide the output of `docker inspect <image>` regardless of where the image is hosted.

## Requirements

- **GitHub Token**: The action requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` to access GitHub APIs (automatically provided)
- **Docker Inspect Data**: Provide JSON output from `docker inspect <image>` command
- **GitHub CLI**: Uses `gh` command (pre-installed on GitHub runners)
- **Permissions**: Requires `packages: read` permission to access container registry

### Required Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: read
  actions: read
```

## Example Workflows

### Complete CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
name: Complete CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: read
  actions: read

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        run: |
          # Your build and push logic here
          echo "Building and pushing image..."
          
  check-acceptance-needed:
    needs: build-and-push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      should-run: ${{ steps.check.outputs.should-run }}
      reason: ${{ steps.check.outputs.reason }}
      new-images-count: ${{ steps.check.outputs.new-images-count }}
    steps:
      - name: Check if acceptance tests should run
        id: check
        uses: optivem/should-run-acceptance-stage-action@v1
        with:
          repo-owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          repo-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          image-name: 'my-app'
          workflow-name: 'acceptance.yml'
          
      - name: Log decision
        run: |
          echo "Should run acceptance: ${{ steps.check.outputs.should-run }}"
          echo "Reason: ${{ steps.check.outputs.reason }}"
          echo "New images found: ${{ steps.check.outputs.new-images-count }}"
          
  acceptance-tests:
    needs: check-acceptance-needed
    if: needs.check-acceptance-needed.outputs.should-run == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run acceptance tests
        run: |
          echo "Running acceptance tests..."
          echo "Reason: ${{ needs.check-acceptance-needed.outputs.reason }}"
          # Your acceptance test commands here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Package Not Found (404)**
   - The action will default to running acceptance stage for safety
   - Ensure the package name format is correct: `repo-name/image-name`

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Verify `packages: read` permission is granted
   - Check if the repository has container packages published

3. **API Rate Limiting**
   - The action uses authenticated requests which have higher rate limits
   - Consider adding delays between workflow runs if hitting limits

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository settings.
